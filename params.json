{"name":"A2EPG","tagline":"Assisted Analysis of Electrical Penetration Graph","body":"A2EPG is a new software application capable of automatically analyze signals derived from the electrical penetration graphs (EPG), a technique widely used to monitoring the plant probing behavior of hemipterean insects. A2EPG incorporates search engines for five EPG waveforms (Np, C, pd, G and E1) and provides output information indicating the time spans of each recognized waveform, which can be easily confirmed or manipulated by an expert user, reducing the overall time devoted to the analysis of EPG data.\r\n\r\nVisit [a2epg.cl](http://a2epg.cl) for more info.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\nA2EPG was developed using the Qt cross-platform application & UI development framework, so it's necessary to build A2EPG from source. A2EPG code is Qt 5 compatible, and the latest tested version was 5.4.0. No other dependencies are required.\r\n\r\n### Tested OS\r\nThe following operating systems versions are known to be compatible with building from source and using the corresponding A2EPG distributed executables.\r\n\r\n* Windows XP, 7, 8 and 8.1.\r\n* MacOS X 10.9+.\r\n* Ubuntu 13.10+ and CentOS 7.\r\n\r\nCiting\r\n-------\r\nA2EPG was developed with research purposes and it should be cited by their associated scientific article:\r\n\r\n> Adasme-Carre√±o, F., et al.
